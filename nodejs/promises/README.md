# Promises: Please promise me to make Promises easier to comprehend in the future JavaScript versions

Somehow I just can't fully grasp the correct use of JavaScript promises. The code in this directory is my notes of learning how to use them.

Here are some references:
- [1] [Promises/A+](https://promisesaplus.com/)
- [2] [MDN: Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
- [3] [javascript.info: Promises, async/await](https://javascript.info/async)

How to run the code:
- Install `node.js` v14.18.0+.
- Run `node <filename>`. For example: `node executor-no-params.js`.
